.TH CLIN-DB 1
.SH NAME
clink-db \- C/C++/assembly code navigator and full AST generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B \fBclink-db\fR \fIoptions...\fR [\fIpaths...\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
CLINK-DB is a replacement for cscope that uses libclang/clang/clang++, features syntax
highlighting, multicore support, and more.
.SH OPTIONS
\fB--full-ast\fR, \fB-a\fR
.RS
Uses clang/clang++ for emit AST for source inputs, by default it uses libclang which does
not generate full AST.
.RE
.PP
\fB--all-files\fR
.RS
All files are treated as C/C++, it tries with both clang/clang++ to emit AST, useful when there are
source files with unusual extensions and libmagic does not detect their content. Valid only with
\fI--full-ast\fR option.
.RE
.PP
\fB--build-only\fR, \fB-b\fR
.RS
Exit after constructing or updating the symbol database. That is, do not load a
user interface.
.RE
.PP
\fB--colour\fR \fIwhen\fR, \fB--color\fR \fIwhen\fR
.RS
Enable or disable the use of ANSI colour codes. Possible values of \fIwhen\fR
are "always" (enable), "never" (disable), and "auto" (decide based on whether
stdout is a TTY).
.RE
.PP
\fB--database\fR \fIFILE\fR, \fB-f\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS
Open or create the symbol database at path \fIFILE\fR. Without this option,
clink-db will default to opening the file clink-db.sqlite3 in the current directory or any
parent thereof if it exists. If none of these exist, clink-db will fallback
to clink-db.sqlite3 in the current directory.
.RE
.PP
\fB--debug\fR
.RS
Enable clink-db debugging mode. This is intended for debugging problems within
clink-db itself.
.RE
.PP
\fB--help\fR, \fB-h\fR
.RS
Display this help information.
.RE
.PP
\fB--help-cx\fR, \fB-H\fR
.RS
Display CXCursorKind information.
.RE
.PP
\fB--include\fR \fIPATH\fR, \fB-I\fR \fIPATH\fR
.RS
Include the given directory in the search path for C/C++ #includes. By default,
the list of include paths is your compiler's default. Equivalent, variables CPATH,
C_INCLUDE_PATH, CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH can be exported to environment.
.RE
.PP
\fB--kernel\fR, \fB-k\fR
.RS
"Kernel Mode", turns off the use of the default include dir (usually /usr/include)
when building the database, since kernel source trees generally do not use it.
.RE
.PP
\fB--skip-vim\fR, \fB-S\fR
.RS
Does not insert data in tables content and records, useful for fast symbol processing.
.RE
.PP
\fB--jobs\fR \fINUM\fR, \fB-j\fR \fINUM\fR
.RS
Use the given number of threads when performing multithreaded operations. You
can also pass the special value "auto" (the default) which uses the number of
processors in your system.
.RE
.PP
\fB-l\fR
.RS
Use the line-oriented interface instead of the NCurses-based interface. The
line-oriented interface mimics cscope's behavior just enough to feed Vim the
information it needs. It is missing all other functions and is not intended for
interactive use by a human.
.RE
.PP
\fB--no-build\fR, \fB-d\fR
.RS
Do not update the database.
.RE
.PP
\fB-s\fR \fIPATH\fR
.RS
Add the given path to the list to search for files to index. This has the same
effect as including the \fIPATH\fR standalone at the end of your clink-db
invocation; the \fB-s\fR option is only provided for backwards compatibility
with cscope.
.RE
.PP
\fB--language\fR, \fB-x\fR \fITYPE\fR
.RS
Treat subsequent input files as having \fITYPE\fR C or C++. Clink-db uses libmagic by default
when used with the -a option to detect the file type. This option sets the CLINK_CC
environment variable to clang or clang++.
.RE
.PP
\fB--cflags\fR \fIFILE\fR, \fB-C\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS
Give additional arguments to clang (similar with make CFLAGS) when used with the -a option.
All arguments must be on a single line separated by spaces.
.RE
.PP
\fB--cxxflags\fR \fIFILE\fR, \fB-X\fR \fIFILE\fR
.RS
Give additional arguments to clang++ (similar with make CXXFLAGS) when used with the -a option.
All arguments must be on a single line separated by spaces.
