A sort of plan of attack:

 - Store line contents of files in the database to avoid re-reading them at the
   point where we're in the UI.
 - Implement fleshed out Cscope masquerading.
 - Multithreading.
 - Vim pipe for syntax highlighting.
 - Assembly parser.
 - Think about disk space? The database and the history file are surprisingly
   bloated.
