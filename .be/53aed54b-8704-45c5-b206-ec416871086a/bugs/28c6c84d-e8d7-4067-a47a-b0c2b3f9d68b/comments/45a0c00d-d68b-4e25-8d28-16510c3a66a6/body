The current approach in the C++ parser is to throw any included file to the work
queue. This works, but a side effect is that a modified file results in every
file it includes being considered modified as well. Most files include at least
one system header, which results in a lengthy time to re-parse any file as we
spend time re-highlighting the system headers. We should be able to suppress
this relatively easily within the work queue.
