Moving data in and out of SQLite is fragile because we don't have a
compiler-enforced calling convention across the boundary. This has
already bitten me multiple times with, e.g., queries that fail to
prepare because they don't match the table schema.

I think we have enough leverage to introduce a SQLAlchemy-esque
abstraction that gives us approximate type safety while also fully
collapsing at compile-time. Requires more research, but seems eminently
doable.
