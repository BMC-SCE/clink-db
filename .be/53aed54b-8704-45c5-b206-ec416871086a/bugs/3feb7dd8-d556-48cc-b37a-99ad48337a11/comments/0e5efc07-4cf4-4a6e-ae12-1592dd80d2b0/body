The parent of a symbol is used by us to indicate the containing function
in various scenarios. For instance, we use this information to give
sensible output for a callees search. However, this information seems
inaccurate. For function calls this often indicates no parent
("<global>"). For example, calls to `lstrip` in the current code base
are indicated as global.

A simpler alternative may be to not ask Clang about the semantic parent
at all, but instead note a parent whenever we pass a class or function
definition while descending the hierarchy. This should actually be
slightly faster too, so bonus.
