I haven't worked out a pattern yet, but certain function calls are not detected
during analysis. For example, in some code like the following:

    if (f()) {
        g();
        if (h()) {
            i();
        }
    }

g was detected as a function call, but the others were not. I'm not sure whether
perhaps g was the only one of the four whose definition was seen within the same
translation unit. This was also C code, as opposed to C++, though I don't know
whether the difference was relevant. Requires more investigation.
