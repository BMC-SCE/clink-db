For some reason, Cscope results differ between the line-oriented and
curses-based interfaces. I don't fully understand why, and this does not
appear to be documented behaviour. A reproducible case is:

    $ cat 'include "../bar.h"' >foo/foo.c
    $ cscope
      # a query for includers of "bar.h" will match "foo/foo.c"
    $ cscope -l
      # a query for includers of "bar.h" will not match "foo/foo.c"

We don't have much choice other than to mimic Cscope's unorthodox
behaviour here. It turns out this is actually easier anyway, which
perhaps is why Cscope does this.
